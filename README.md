# Banknote-Recognition
Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from re-
duced or absent vision.It might be challenging for those with
visual impairments to discern between different cash denomi-
nations and currencies. This work takes a dataset of different
currencies, trains the model to recognise the denomination,
currency, and orientation, and then provides the user with the
information.The dataset consists of 24,826 photos of banknotes
in various assistive settings, including 112 denominations and
17 different currencies. We create a machine learning model
for worldwide money recognition using supervised contrastive
learning. With the help of this model, banknote images can
be embedded compliantly in a range of scenarios.We compare
the performance of two machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF)—in recognizing the
banknotes.Our analysis provides insights into the feasibility of
each method for practical assistive applications by comparing
their relative efficiency in terms of accuracy and computing
performance
